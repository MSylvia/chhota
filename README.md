**Chhota is a front end url shortener without the need for a Database.**

It runs a sort of mirror on http://goo.gl, and uses the *#* to keep the process completely on the front end.

Install it on your site with just one line in your `index.html` - 

`<script src="http://chhota.ga/chhota.js"></script>`

Now you can shorten URLs at http://chhota.ga - Get the code, and append it to your domain.

## Explainer Example

1. I add chhota to http://jajoosam.tech - with one line in by index.html.
2. I get the chhota code for google.com here - http://chhota.ga/#create=google.com - It is #$mR2d
3. I go to http://jajoosam.tech/#$mR2d - and boom I'm on Google!
